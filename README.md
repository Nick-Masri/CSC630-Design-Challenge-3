# CSC630-Design-Challenge-3

This app is a hangman app that tests you on your knowledge of star wars characters. This uses SWAPI (the star wars api) and swapi-node to easily pull the names of the characters.

## Installation

You will have to have the expo app on your phone in order to test this app.

```
git clone
npm install
npm start
```

Once you run the above commands, if you open the expo app on your phone and scan the qr code from the console you should see the app.
